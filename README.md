# Homepage
The homepage has a navigation bar that contains the logo, home, about, contact, blog, and a login button. After that, there is a banner for the page, followed by a showcase of all the chefs. Each chef card contains all the necessary information about the chef, and by clicking on the "View Recipe" button, you can view their recipes. The images use lazyloader to ensure that all the images don't load at once.

Additionally, there are two extra sections. The first section is about the rich food history of Italy, and the second section is a "Socials" section. At the bottom of the page, there is a footer.

# Login and Registration

After completing your registration, you will be redirected to your designated page. Your profile picture will show up in the navbar beside the logout button. If you hover over the picture, you will see your display name, if you have one. If you don't have an image, it will show "Profile" instead.

# Recipe Page
The recipe page has a banner for the chef with their details, and there are also their top three recipes with pictures, names, ingredients, and cooking methods.
